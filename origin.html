		<h1>How'd was the Idea of Bubble Tea Created?</h1>
		<p>
		<br>
		In the 1980s, the owner of a small tea house in Taiwan came up with the idea 
		during a meeting. 
		<br> 
		<br>Chun Shui Tang, a teahouse in Taichung had recently started
		selling tea cold, inspired by Japanese-style iced coffee. Lin Hsiu Hui, the 
		manager of product development at the teahouse had lost interest during a staff
		meeting and poured her Fen Yuan (a Taiwanese sweetened tapioca pudding) into her 
		Assam iced tea. 
		<br>
		<br>After she tried her creation she added it to the menu because of 
		how tasty it was. Soon, it was the number-one item at the teahouse and other 
		places started copying the idea. Hence, the birth of a stunning creation, bubble
		tea.
